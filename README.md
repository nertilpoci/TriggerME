# TriggerME
## Idea
Trigger commands from web hooks on a desktop client(currently windows only)
Example: Trigger computer shutdown when an event happens and you call the specific trigger.

**How it works**
1. Create client
2. Add some triggers to the client
3. Download desktop client
4. Connect to the client
5. Go to triggers and set action for triggers(currently only run a file or program supported)
6. Get the trigger url from the web client and call it from you preferred location
